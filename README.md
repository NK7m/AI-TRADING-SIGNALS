## 🚀 Overview

AI Trading Bot 2.0 is a modular, lightweight, and highly customizable AI-powered trading assistant designed for **crypto, forex, stocks, commodities, and indices**. It delivers ultra-accurate, real-time trading signals by combining technical analysis, AI-based pattern recognition, and market sentiment from news and social media. The bot is optimized for low-end devices (no GPU required) and supports seamless integration with Discord and Telegram for instant alerts.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Real-Time Trading Signals:**  
  Generates buy/sell/hold signals with confidence percentage, risk/reward ratio, and market condition (trending, consolidating, volatile, etc.).

- **Custom Signal Timing:**  
  User-defined intervals (1min, 5min, 15min, 1H, 4H, daily) with backtesting and optimization for each timeframe.

- **Market Data & Indicators:**  
  Fetches real-time data from APIs (TradingView, Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Binance, etc.) and supports advanced indicators (RSI, MACD, EMA/SMA, Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci, volume, and more).

- **AI-Based Pattern Recognition:**  
  Detects classic chart patterns (triangles, wedges, head & shoulders, etc.) using lightweight ML models.

- **Market Sentiment Analysis:**  
  Analyzes breaking news and Twitter/X sentiment using NLP to classify market mood (bullish, bearish, neutral).

- **Asset Coverage:**  
  Scans all major assets—crypto, forex pairs, stocks, commodities (gold, oil), and indices (NIFTY, NASDAQ, etc.) with filtering options.

- **Discord/Telegram Integration:**  
  Sends real-time, formatted trading signals to users. If signal confidence > 75%, notifies @everyone or selected traders.

- **Risk Management:**  
  Suggests stop-loss and take-profit levels, calculates risk based on portfolio size or margin, and provides risk/reward ratios.

- **Backtesting & Paper Trading:**  
  Simulates trades on historical data, visualizes performance (profit curve, win ratio, drawdown), and exports results to CSV/Excel.

- **Web Dashboard (Optional):**  
  Simple frontend to monitor signals and bot performance.

- **Modular & Scalable:**  
  Easily extendable codebase for new models, indicators, or integrations.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   Fetches real-time and historical market data, news, and social sentiment.

2. **Feature Extraction:**  
   Computes technical indicators and extracts features for AI models.

3. **Signal Generation:**  
   Lightweight AI models (XGBoost, RandomForest, DistilBERT, etc.) analyze features and sentiment to generate trading signals with confidence scores.

4. **Risk Management:**  
   Calculates stop-loss, take-profit, and risk/reward based on user profile and market volatility.

5. **Signal Delivery:**  
   Sends formatted alerts to Discord/Telegram and (optionally) displays them on a web dashboard.

6. **Backtesting & Optimization:**  
   Simulates strategies on historical data and visualizes performance.
